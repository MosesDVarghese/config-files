# My dotfiles

<summary>Waybar</summary>

I prefer GNOME's minimalistic status bar and have tried to replicate it with Waybar. But whenever I do need more info I can click on icons which will reveal its expanded view.

<summary>Wofi</summary>

Wofi has been modified to have a more smooth look (rounded corners and dark color scheme) than what it ships with by default.
